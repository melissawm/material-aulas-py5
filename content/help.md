# How To Help

Right now the most important thing I need is for people to try py5 and
provide feedback.

It would also be great if someone was willing to help write tutorials
and example code. Right now that area of the documentation is seriously
lacking.

All of the bugs I'd like help with are listed on Github with the [help
wanted](https://github.com/hx2A/py5generator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
tag.

In time I'll update this page as this project's needs evolve.
